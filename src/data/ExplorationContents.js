                    Now that you've outlined your budget and home preferences, it's time to build your team, starting with a lender and realtor (real estate agent), attorney, and inspector. For a reliable lender, seek recommendations from family, friends, and the BHC, which provides a list of approved lenders. When selecting a real estate professional, consider referrals, conduct research on brokers or independent agents, and use resources like realtor.com to find licensed agents in your area.

                    Once you've established your budget and *obtained your credit report*, it's time to embark on the search for a mortgage lender. It's crucial to undertake this step after completing the entire preparation phase, as it allows you to determine a comfortable down payment amount and understand the the amount of money per mortgage payment you can afford. Selecting the right lender is important, and verifying their licensing is essential.

                Selecting your home is the fun partâ€”tour houses with your agent, take notes, and make a pros and cons list. When you find the right one, discuss and submit an offer, but before finalizing, reassess your budget to include all closing costs and potential expenses like repairs and utilities. This ensures a smooth transition without financial surprises.
