                    Now that you've outlined your budget and home preferences, it's time to build your team, starting with a lender and a realtor or real estate agent. For a reliable lender, seek recommendations from family, friends, and the BHC, which provides a list of approved lenders. When selecting a real estate professional, consider referrals, conduct research on brokers or independent agents, and use resources like realtor.com to find licensed agents in your area.

                    Establish your budget and obtain your credit report before initiating the search for a mortgage lender. After completing the preparation phase, assess a comfortable down payment and monthly mortgage payment, ensuring to choose a licensed lender—seek recommendations, consult the BHC, and utilize the NMLS database for verification.

                    Once pre-approved, it's time to start searching for your new home. Use Zillow and recommendations from your realtor, and be sure to communicate your updated budget, must-haves, location preferences to your realtor, before you finally, choose a home!

                    Selecting your home is the fun part—tour houses with your agent, take notes, and make a pros and cons list. When you find the right one, discuss and submit an offer, but before finalizing, reassess your budget to include all closing costs and potential expenses like repairs and utilities. This ensures a smooth transition without financial surprises.
