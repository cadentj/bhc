                Making an offer is a pivotal step in the homebuying journey, where you formally express your intent to purchase a property. During this process, you will propose a price, along with any conditions or contingencies, to the seller. Work with your realtor to make a well-crafted offer, it sets the foundation for negotiations, determines the terms of the sale, and ultimately plays a key role in securing the desired property at a fair price.

                Even if your home looks perfect, it is crucial to have the home inspected. This will make sure that the home is in fact flawless and there is no serious or structural damage that was not disclosed to you. If there is certain damage that was not disclosed you are able to rescind your offer and get the deposit back or work with the seller to make repairs or discount the price.

                    After accepting an offer, submit necessary documents to finalize your mortgage, including the signed purchase agreement, employment verification, rental history, proof of down payment, and any other relevant explanations. Be ready to purchase homeowner's insurance as prompted by your lender, ensuring affordability to avoid more expensive forced insurance. Keep in mind potential upfront payments of 10-20% of your annual premium and add all documents to your organized folder.
