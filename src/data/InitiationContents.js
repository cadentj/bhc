                    Now that you've outlined your budget and home preferences, it's time to build your team, starting with a lender and a realtor or real estate agent. For a reliable lender, seek recommendations from family, friends, and the BHC, which provides a list of approved lenders. When selecting a real estate professional, consider referrals, conduct research on brokers or independent agents, and use resources like realtor.com to find licensed agents in your area.

                    Now that you have accepted an offer, it is time to also go back to your lender with additional documents to have your mortgage finalized. These documents include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contract to purchase: the signed purchase and sale agreement. If there is any seller credit for closing costs, this must be included</li>
                    <li>Verification of employment (if requested)</li>
                    <li>Rental History: This is to prove you have a history of paying on time</li>
                    <li>Proof of Down payment and Closing Funds</li>
                    <li>Any other documents that may explain exigent circumstances</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    During this stage, your lender or loan specialist will let you know when you are ready to buy homeownerâ€™s insurance. Make sure you are able to afford this because if not, the lender will force insurance on your home which will be MORE expensive. Additionally, keep in mind your lender may require you to pay 10-20% of your annual home insurance premium upfront so it is crucial to have some additional funds set aside for this.
